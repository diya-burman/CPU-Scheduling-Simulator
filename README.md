# CPU Scheduling Simulator â€“ CPU AlgoSched
Welcome to CPU AlgoSched, a web-based CPU scheduling simulator designed to help users learn, visualize, and compare various CPU scheduling algorithms interactively.

# Overview
This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms to demonstrate how different algorithms impact system performance. The goal is to help understand and compare the efficiency of different scheduling strategies used by operating systems for CPU resource allocation.

# Key Features
- Interactive Gantt Chart Simulator
- Algorithm Documentation with Visuals
- Performance Metric Comparison

# Supported Algorithms
- **FCFS (First Come First Serve)**
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
- **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)**
- **Priority Scheduling**
- **Priority Premptive**
- **Round Robin (RR)**

# Each algorithm is presented with:
- Description
- Characteristics
- Pros & Cons
- Use Cases
